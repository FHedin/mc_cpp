<!-- Please note that node names and attributes names are case sensitive.

For example :
* inputFile, inputfile and INPUTFILE are not the same
* and also ens_type, Ens_Type and ENS_TYPE are not the same

BUT values of attributes are case insensitive 
* MDBAS or mdbas, CHARMM or Charmm .. are valid ...
With TWO exception : 
* path to files : ./ff.dat is NOT ./FF.dat
* value of sele="ARR" is not the same as sele="arr" for atoms selections

Please refer to documentation for a full description of accepted nodes and attributes names and values for those.

         * move_mode is "all", "residue" or "atom" : when applying a move it decides if we apply this to all 
            atoms of the selection at once, or only to the residue containing the atom selection, or only to the atom selection.
         * note that move_type="rot" and  move_mode="atom" is impossible as we can't rotate just one atom
