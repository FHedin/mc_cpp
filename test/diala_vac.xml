<!-- Please note that node names and attributes names are case sensitive.

For example :
* inputFile, inputfile and INPUTFILE are not the same
* and also ens_type, Ens_Type and ENS_TYPE are not the same

BUT values of attributes are case insensitive 
* MDBAS or mdbas, CHARMM or Charmm .. are valid ...
With TWO exception : 
* path to files : ./ff.dat is NOT ./FF.dat
* value of sele="ARR" is not the same as sele="arr" for atoms selections

Please refer to documentation for a full description of accepted nodes and attributes names and values for those.

  <!-- * Now we can define the Monte Carlo move types which will allow us to focus
            more on some atoms than others for example.
         * the movelist contains one or more eclarations of <move> where we define the stuff
         * move_type="rot" is either "rot" for rotations or "trn" for translation
         * move_mode is "all", "residue" or "atom" : when applying a move it decides if we apply this to all 
            atoms of the selection at once, or only to the residue containing the atom selection, or only to the atom selection.
         * note that move_type="rot" and  move_mode="atom" is impossible as we can't rotate just one atom
         * Then the atom selection is given using this selection node
         * One selection only for each <move ... for the moment
         * sel_mode are :
            "all" or "none" which are explicit enough...
            "residue_id" which uses the column 2 of cor files, "residue_name" using column 3
            "atom_idx" which uses the column 1 of the cor file
            Other types coming soon but not yet implemented ...
         * sele="..." is simply the string containing the selection (unused for sel_mode "all" or "none")
         * dmax_value is a scaling factor applies to translation or rotation vectors applied to the atoms when moving
            it is possible to adjust automatically its value for reaching dmax_target % of acceptance
            dmax_each is used for choosing at which interval in steps we try to optimize dmax, if 0 optimization is disabled
